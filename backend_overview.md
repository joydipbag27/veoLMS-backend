## Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Session Management
- **Register** — Email + username + password. Password hashed with bcryptjs.
- **Login** — Validates credentials, creates a signed session in Redis, sets a signed `sid` cookie.
- **Google OAuth** — Login / register via Google ID token (`google-auth-library`).
- **OTP Verification** — Send and verify a one-time password for email verification or 2FA flows.
- **Logout** — Deletes the current device session from Redis.
- **Logout All Devices** — Deletes all sessions for a user from Redis using the `userIdIndex` FT search index.
- **Forgot Password** — Sends a reset OTP via Resend email service.
- **Change Password** — Authenticated users can change their existing password.
- **Set Password** — Allows users who signed up via Google (no password) to set one.

### 👤 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Three roles are defined in `config/roles.js`:

| Role | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| `STUDENT` | Enroll in courses, access allowed lessons |
| `CREATOR` | All STUDENT abilities + create/manage their own courses, sections, lessons |
| `ADMIN` | Full access to everything including user management |

**Admin operations:**
- View all users (paginated)
- Check a specific user's session status
- Force-logout any user's session
- Block / Unblock users
- Change a user's role
- Permanently delete a user account

### 📚 LMS Content Management

#### Courses
- Full CRUD for courses.
- Courses have a `status` of `Draft` or `Published`.
- `GET /course/creator/me` supports `?status=Draft`, `?status=Published`, or `?status=All` to fetch all in a single call.
- All list endpoints support cursor-based pagination (`?cursor=<id>&limit=<n>`).
- Cascading delete: deleting a course also deletes all its sections and lessons.

#### Sections
- Scoped to a course. Ordered by `order` field.
- **Order validation**: Duplicate `order` values within the same course are rejected (`409 Conflict`) at both the controller level and the DB level (compound unique index on `{ course, order }`).
- Cascading delete: deleting a section also deletes all its lessons.

#### Lessons
- Scoped to a section (and course). Ordered by `order` field.
- **Order validation**: Duplicate `order` values within the same section are rejected (`409 Conflict`) at both the controller level and the DB level (compound unique index on `{ section, order }`).
- `isPreview` flag marks a lesson as accessible to any authenticated user without enrollment.

### 🎟️ Enrollment System
- Students can enroll in any `Published` course.
- **Business rules enforced:**
  - User must be authenticated.
  - Course must exist and be `Published` (not `Draft`).
  - The course creator cannot enroll in their own course.
  - A user can only enroll once (compound unique index on `{ user, course }`).
- Enrollment status: `Active` or `Completed`.

### 🔒 Lesson Access Control
Lesson access is determined by a strict middleware chain. The exact priority order is:

```
Is user authenticated?
    NO  → 401 Unauthorized
    YES ↓
Is user ADMIN?
    YES → Allow (full access)
    NO  ↓
Is user the course Creator?
    YES → Allow (full access)
    NO  ↓
Is the lesson marked isPreview?
    YES → Allow (any authenticated user)
    NO  ↓
Is user Enrolled (Active) in this course?
    YES → Allow
    NO  → 403 Forbidden
```

This logic applies to:
- `GET /lesson/:id` — via `checkLessonAccess` middleware.
- `GET /lesson/section/:sectionId` — inline access control in the controller, using `optionalAuthenticate` to handle both logged-in and logged-out users gracefully.

### 📦 File Storage (Backblaze B2)
- Generate **pre-signed upload URLs** so clients upload directly to B2, not through the server.
- Generate **pre-signed download URLs** for secure, time-limited file access.
- Permanent deletion utility (`permanentlyDeleteMultipleFromB2`) handles versioned objects and delete markers.

| `title` | String | Required |
| `description` | String | Optional |
| `course` | ObjectId → Course | Required, indexed |
| `order` | Number | Required; unique within course |

### `Lesson`

> Compound unique index on `{ user, course }` prevents duplicate enrollments.

### `OTP`
Stores short-lived OTPs for email verification and password resets (TTL-managed).

## Middleware

| Middleware | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `authenticate` | `middlewares/authenticate.js` | Validates signed `sid` cookie via Redis. Populates `req.user`. Rejects with `401` if missing or expired. |
| `optionalAuthenticate` | `middlewares/optionalAuthenticate.js` | Same as `authenticate` but does **not** reject unauthenticated requests. Used on routes that serve tiered responses (e.g. lesson list). |
| `authorize` | `middlewares/authorize.js` | Role guard. Rejects with `403` if `req.user.role` is not in the allowed roles list. |
| `checkLessonAccess` | `middlewares/lessonAccess.js` | LMS access control middleware. Enforces the Admin → Creator → Preview → Enrolled hierarchy. |
| `customRateLimit` | `middlewares/rateLimit.js` | Wraps `express-rate-limit`. Called as `customRateLimit(windowMinutes, maxRequests)`. |
| Error Handler | `app.js` (global) | Catches Mongoose validation errors, duplicate key errors (`11000`), operational errors (`isOperational`), and unknown errors. |

|---|---|---|
| Mongoose `ValidationError` | `400` | Schema validation failures |
| MongoDB Duplicate Key (`11000`) | `409` | Unique index violations (e.g., duplicate email, duplicate order) |
| Operational errors (`isOperational: true`) | Varies | Custom app errors thrown with a status code |
| Unknown / programming errors | `500` | Unexpected exceptions |
